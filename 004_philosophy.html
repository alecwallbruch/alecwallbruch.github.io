  <h1>Why Philosophy?</h1>
  <h3>and why I love it!</h3>

  <h2>Philosophy gets you thinking</h2>
	<p>I took my first philosophy class during my freshman year of college, and it was titled "The Meaning 
of Life." Pretty heavy topic if you ask me, but I welcomed the mental challenge ahead of me! 
The class made me confront ideas that I tried to avoid, such as why do people have morals? Why should we 
care for people other than ourselves? Or what happens after we die?</p>
	<p>Those are loaded questions, but they are questions that make you dig down inside you and 
question what you believe in and why you do. Thinking about these things is a part of being human.</p>

  <h2>Philosophy keeps me grounded</h2>
	<p>Depending on what one believes in, it's easy to get caught up in one's thoughts. The idea 
of death is always one that scares me the most to think about, especially because it's challenging 
to grasp the idea of forever. Taking philosophy courses has forced me to come face to face with many 
ideas that are similarly as difficult to think about, like is there really such thing as true objectivity? 
Or are we able to prove our existence?</p>
	<p> The difficulty or ambiguity of these questions are not what keep me grounded, but instead 
that I have the ability to think about them at all. It is fascinating that someone, whether it be you 
or me, has the capacity to even start to answer these questions.</p>

  <h2>Philosophy makes you a better person</h2>
	<p>Surely that claim sounds outrageous, but to me, it's true. Simply taking a single philosophy 
course will not make you a better person. Passing that class is not the key to enlightenment. What does 
make you a better person though, is having a reason to learn new things and explore different viewpoints. 
I never thought I would take a class that asked me if I think someone has the right to die, but after 
being exposed to that idea, it led me down a path that helped me learn what can make people's lives 
better.</p>
	<p>Being actively engaged in the world around you makes you a more experienced, understanding, 
and caring person. Regardless of what you think or feel, you have learned more about the world around 
you and that made you more human; and I've never heard anyone say being more human is a bad thing.</p>
