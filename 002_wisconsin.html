  <h2>My Student Life</h2>
	<p>I first enrolled in UW-Madison as a Mechanical Engineer, but I quickly realized I was better suited 
to be a Statistics major, which I will now graduate as. I have had a difficult 3 years at Wisconsin, but 
every time I take a walk around campus I remember why I work hard to stay at this beautiful school.</p>

  <h2>Activities I'm Involved In</h2>
	<p>When I first came to school I did not intend on joining greek-life. It was not until I felt 
extremely lonely in the dorms that I decided to rush. I'm now a part of Beta Theta Pi and I've made some 
of the best friends I could have ever asked for. I also partake in many intramural sports to keep myself 
active and retain my competitive spirit.</p>
	<p>My personal favorite activity is <a href="https://www.humorology.org/" target = "_blank">
Humorology.</a> Humo is a variety show put on by casts made 
entirely of students within greek-life, with the main goal being to raise as much money as possible 
for the selected charity that year. I had the pleasure of being a director of my cast sophomore year 
and it was incredible. While we didn't get to perform our show last year, my cast freshman year was 
able to.</p>
