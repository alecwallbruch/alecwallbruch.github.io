  <h2>I live in a massive city in Illinois!</h2>
	<p>Aurora, Illinois has a population of almost 200,000 people, making it second to only Chicago. 
As you might have guessed because I live in a massive city, <a href="http://wvhs.ipsd.org/" target="_blank">
my high school</a>
was also ginormous! I went to school with over 2,700 students, 860 of which were in my class!</p>

  <h2>Why I love my city so much</h2>
	<p>Growing up only a 30 minute drive away from Chicago was awesome. I got to experience 
life growing up in the suburbs while being so close to the best city in the world. It was only 
once I left my city did I realize how much I love it. I get to root 
for the Cubs, and in 2016, I was rewarded with the best perk a Chicagoland citizen can get: 
a Cubs World Series win.</p>
