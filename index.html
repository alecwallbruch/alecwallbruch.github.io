  <h2>Where I'm from and what I do in life</h2>
	<p>I'm from Aurora, Illinois, a large suburb west of Chicago. 
I've lived there all my life until I moved to Madison, Wisconsin for school. 
I study Statistics at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target ="_blank">
University of Wisconsin</a> and want to pursue a career in 
sociology involving statistics.</p>

  <h2>What I'm passionate about</h2>
	<p>As you might be able to guess, I'm very passionate about social science 
and the study of populations of people. My more interesting passions are going on vacations
 and studying philosophy; and finally, my most controversial passion is for politics.</p>
